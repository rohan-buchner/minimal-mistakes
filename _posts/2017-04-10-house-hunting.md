## House hunting induced ranting

Before I get into it, I'd like to deviate off topic somewhat just to set the scene as is where.

I often wonder what the ideal answer is to this. Living in South Africa is currently making things that (I'd assume) the previous generation took for granted, very hard or unatainable. I've often been told by partents, older friends, or even my current generation peers: "Renting is just you paying off someone elses bond"...

While the above stament is 100% true, the alternative options isn't viable for most 90s or post-millenials, unless you have access to "old money", that, coupled with a failing economy, makes for a scary reality for anyone seeking to purchase, invest or save up for retirement.

In Cape Town CBD the general cost of a 1 bedroom bachelors apartment is round about 9000 - 10000 ZAR, this cost, or notion of paying this rent is also made less appealing taking into account a bond of about 1 000 000 ZAR, will equal a repayment of more or less the same (...without levies and insurance etc)

I'm of the opinion that living in the CBD is:

- somewhat safer (being that statistically South Africais one of the most dangerous countries in the world)
- lifestyle wise its more convenient
