This is my first attempt at anything Ruby & Jekyll related, as well as "hosting" anything on github. The experience was quite... pleasant actually.

Give or take a few hours and I have my own space where I can ~~vent~~ write about things that inspire or cause despair on a daily basis.

Currently I'm working in the financial data analytics space, so I'm expecting to write the odd post about what I've done, or aim to do, but for the most part I'm hoping to turn this into a learning experience and platform where I can write about my dabblings in technology. 

... oh, and expect <a href="http://anemptycity.bandcamp.com/track/ukufa" target="\_blank">links</a> to music too
